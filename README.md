# Week 2 TicTacToe Rspec

In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
Players will soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw.
Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy. 

## How do we play Tic Tac Toe?

Players take turns playing: 
- 1st turn ‚Äî Player 1: 
Player 1 places their token (X) in only 1 square of their choice
- 2nd turn ‚Äî Player 2:
 Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can‚Äôt touch the square that Player 1‚Äôs token already fills
- 3rd turn- Player 1 ‚Ä¶. and the cycle continues until a player wins or there‚Äôs a tie game

There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal
There‚Äôs a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs but no winning combinations can be found.

## Prequisites

Ruby installed on your local machine.
Terminal or similar to execute the program.

## Testing
In this project the testing was done using RSpec to test all game logic methods.

## Install
- In a terminal window type gem install rspec
- Once rspec install has finished, type rspec --init
- You will see a folder spec and a file .rspec
- Inside spec folder you'll see a spec_helper.rb file.

## Run
We have already created rspec-testing files called logic.rb, and settings.rb.
